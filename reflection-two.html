        Reflection #2<br>
        Total: 80<br><br>
        •	What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions? (5 Points)<br>
        o	One of the main topics that we studied this week was influence and being an influencer. Everyone has influence. Influence is what you do versus what you say. It is the passion that people will follow you, and not your product.<br><br> 
        •	What did you learn from the study materials? (5 Points)<br>
        o	I learned that influence is very powerful. And it is very powerful and important in the workplace to get success as a team. I learned that there are seven ways to build influence in the workplace. The seven ways are:<br>
        	Building trusts with your coworkers and people you work with. <br>
        	Being consistent to build reliability<br>
        	To be assertive, but not aggressive <br>
        	Having flexibility <br>
        	Being personal<br>
        	To focus on the actions, rather than focusing on the argument <br>
        	Listen to what others have to say<br>
        I really like the last one on the list. Listening to others and their ideas and opinions helps create a work atmosphere of mutual trust, respect, and mutual teamwork <br><br>
        •	Where did you put your assignments in GitHub? (5 points)<br>
        o	I created my GitHub Repository for this class and created a GitHub Pages website page that has an index.html page that has links to my weekly reflections that I have typed up for this class. They are linked to open up in Microsoft Word. <br><br>
        •	Why is this topic important for teamwork? (20 points)<br>
        o	If you have influence in a team environment, it will others in the group feel like they belong and fit in. If members of your team feel like they fit in and are included, you will have a happier and more productive team and accomplish the goals that you have set all together as a team. You will also have a closer relationship with your coworkers and managers, and a sense of respect will be developed in the team environment. <br><br>
        •	Tell me what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they did not know before? (20 Points). <br>
        o	I was asking my younger brother who is a senior in high school if he thought influence was important working in a team. He answered and said that he felt that it is important but not terrible important. I taught him that having influence is really powerful and beneficial. I then taught him the seven ways to build influence in the workplace and how with influence, you can build a much better working environment for you and your coworkers, and how it can build respect, trust, and overall better relationships with your coworkers. <br><br>
