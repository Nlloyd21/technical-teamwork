        •	What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 pts) <br>
        o	This week for class, I prepared by reading President Henry B Eyring’s talk as well as Elisabeth Kasson’s article. I also came prepared by showing up to class and participated in the discussion. <br><br>
        •	What did I learn from the study material? (5 pts) <br>
        o	One of the insights that I liked from President. Eyring’s talk is that change is a part of life. Growing up and getting older is a big change, but it is a change that can bring so many new things and new opportunities for us in our lives. Change is not always a bad thing. Change can bring some positive into our lives. With the other preparation article I read, one thing that I found really interesting is how three years ago, the most desirable soft skills were having a good work ethic, motivation and initiative, with customer service skills following. Now, the most desirable soft skills are teamwork being at the top, flexibility, and adaptability, and then customer service skills. It seems that it went from being individual skills, to skills that require working with others in a team. <br><br>
        •	Why is this week’s topic important? (5 pts)<br>
        o	Teamwork is an important topic. As we get older and start to find jobs, almost every job has you working in a team of people to accomplish a goal together. It is important to learn attributes/skills what we can use to help be a good team member and contribute to help accomplish the goal that the team is trying to be accomplished. <br><br>
        •	What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10pts)<br>
        o	I think my biggest take-a-way I got this week was when we worked together in our teams to come up with a list of ten principles of teamwork. I really had to think about some good principles for teamwork. It was great collaborating as a team to talk and discuss what traits we thought were important for teamwork. After we did it in our group, it was also insightful to walk around and see what other groups have put down for their list of ten principles and how a lot of us came up with the same traits. <br><br>
        •	How would you explain this week’s topics to a person not in this class? (10 pts)<br>
        o	I would first ask them what do they think working on a team means? I would then also ask them what they think are some important principles of working on a team with people. After they say what they think are some principles to a good team, I would explain some of the top principles that we talked about in class. Some of those being communication, humility, respect, etc. <br><br>
        •	Why is this week’s topic important for teamwork? (20 pts)<br>
        o	It is important for teamwork because we talked, as a team, what principles and traits we thought were important for being on a team. We learned that some of the top principles and characteristics of effective teamwork is to have effective communication, accountability and encouraging new and different opinions. We also did an activity where we had to all work together and communicate to find out what symbol we all had in common. That activity helped teach us that we must communicate with each other to find the solution to problems. <br><br>
        •	How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks? (20 pts)<br>
        o	I plan on sharing my ideas and opinions that I have while we are working on a task. Speaking out is small fear that I have, but I hope to be able to overcome that small fear and start contributing and sharing any thoughts and ideas that I have about the subject we are talking about or the assignment we are trying to complete as a team. <br><br>
        •	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20 pts)<br>
        o	With this week’s topic being about teamwork, I would relate working together as a team and needing each other to accomplish goals, to the atonement of Jesus Christ. With the atonement and Jesus Christ, we can repent for the mistakes and be able to live with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ again. Jesus sacrificed himself so we would be able to change and repent. But, just like a team, it is not a one-sided effort. We must put our effort in for the goal that we want to accomplish. <br><br>
