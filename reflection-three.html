        •	Why is this week’s topic important for teamwork? (20 Points)<br>
        o	Self-Awareness is important for working on a team. If we have self-awareness about ourselves and understand ourselves, then we are able to understand everyone else in your team is different than you and no one is the same. Once we can see and recognize the differences, the team can work more effectively and efficiently.<br><br>
        •	What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 Points)<br>
        o	 To prepare for class on Monday and Wednesday, I came to class with the knowledge and new material that I learned from the prepare assignments. I read and took some written notes in my notebook. <br><br>
        •	What did I learn from the study material? (5 Points)<br>
        o	I think one of my biggest take-aways that I learned from the study material was the differences between introverts and extroverts. Some differences between them are:<br>
        	Extroverts:<br>
        •	Enjoy working in groups<br>
        •	Always ready to try new things<br>
        •	Can express yourself easily <br>
        •	Find good in everything<br><br>
        	Introverts:<br>
        •	Consider things carefully<br>
        •	Prefer to avoid conflict<br>
        •	Good at visualizing and creating<br> 
        •	A lot better listeners <br>
        •	Need time for yourself<br><br>
        o	There are some positives to both introverts and extroverts when working in a team. They complement each other and helps the team work more effectively <br><br>
        •	How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks? (20 Points)<br>
        o	I plan on being a good member of the team and contributing by listening to others. I am a much better listener compared to sharing my thoughts and ideas. I will still share my thoughts and ideas when I need to, but I find myself better at listening to what others have to say.<br><br> 
        •	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20 Points)<br>
        o	Since this week’s topic is about awareness, I could relate it to the gospel by saying that we need to be aware of ourselves, and our actions, thoughts, etc. so that we are able to become more like Jesus Christ and set a perfect example for others just like how we need to have self-awareness when working in groups to help the teamwork effectively. We have to be aware of ourselves and make smart choices and decisions and to not yield to the temptations of Satan. We need to always be aware of ourselves. <br><br>
        •	Where did you put your assignments on GitHub? (5 Points) <br>
        o	I put my assignment for this week (this reflection) on my GitHub pages page with the title “Reflection 3”. <br><br>
        •	What is the most significant take-away that you have gained from this week? (10 Points)<br>
        o	I think the biggest thing that I learned and took away with me this week was the 16 personalities test. It was honestly interesting to take the test and get my results and learn some things about my personality that I did not know about myself until I looked back I realized that it is something that I do because of my personality.<br><br>
        •	What did you learn by explaining this week’s topic to someone not in this class? (10 Points)<br>
        o	I learned that everyone thinks differently. I would ask them questions to about the topic to get their idea of what they thought, and it was just different compared to what others had to say.  <br><br>
