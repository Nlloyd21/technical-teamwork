        •	What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 Points)<br>
        o	To prepare for class this week, I read the articles about self-discipline. With reading those articles, I also jotted down some notes with new things that I learned about self-discipline and why self-discipline is important. <br><br>
        •	What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions? (5 Points)<br>
        o	The main topic of discussion this week was about self-discipline. Self-discipline means to focus on a goal or task that you have the idea of achieving a specific result.<br><br> 
        •	What did I learn from the study material? (5 Points)<br>
        o	 I learned that self-discipline is really important for yourself and on while working on a team. Starting off your day with simply making your bed will get you a small sense of pride that will help give you the encouragement to do other tasks throughout your day. Starting with small simple things will allow you to do even bigger things. Some tips that can help build self-discipline are making practice a daily habit, setting personal goals, define expectations, focus on one skill at a time, and to always remember that having some failures is a big part to succeeding. <br><br>
        •	Why is this week’s topic important for teamwork? (20 Points)<br>
        o	With self-discipline, it allows us to perform well and do high quality work in the workspace and in a team. It allows you to have more self-control and persistence and feel more engaged in the work that they are doing. It can also allow for us to push through tough times. Helps us become less lazy and more engaged in what we’re doing. <br><br>
        •	Write a SMART Goal for next week. (10 Points) <br>
        o	For next week, I want to make it a goal to set a time for me to get out of bed and get ready for the day, rather than sleeping in or just laying on my bed till I have to go to classes. For my smart goal I want to:<br>
        	Specific— set my alarm for 7:00 AM and get up, shower, make breakfast, read my scriptures, say my prayer, make my bed, and head to class. <br>
        	Measurable—the goal is to make this a habit in my life. <br>
        	Achievable—I usually wake up around 7:30, but lay in my bed and not actually do anything productive in the morning. <br>
        	Relevant—I want to form this goal and make me feel better and more productive about myself. <br>
        	Timebound—I will try and stick to this plan the remaining of the semester as best as I can. <br><br>
        •	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20 Points)<br>
        o	We need to have self-discipline and put forth effort and desire to things that we want. We cannot just desire things and want things from God, and not put forth effort. It is not a one-sided thing. We need to start doing simple things, such as starting to go to church every Sunday, reading scriptures daily. After a while, it will be a habit and be a part of your daily life, and you will feel closer to God. <br><br>
        •	What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points) <br>
        o	I think that the biggest take a way I got this week, was doing small things, such as making your bed every day, can be really important and can help you do even bigger things in your day. You’ll feel more accomplished and overall, better about yourself. It makes me want to start making my bed every day and try to be better and more productive. <br>
        •	Where did you put your assignments in GitHub? (5 Points)<br>
        o	I put all my assignments onto GitHub pages as well as the download files to all of them so far. <br>
